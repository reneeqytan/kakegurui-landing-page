**This is the final project of the HTML and CSS foundations course.**

I'm very proud of this webpage, as I have been putting off doing this for a long time. This is actually my 3rd attempt, since I didn't fully understand the concept of flexbox in the past 2 attempts. I guess that's an important and valuable lesson.

Inspiration for this webpage is credited in the header.
