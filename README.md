# kakegurui-landing-page

**This is the final project of the HTML and CSS foundations course for the Odin Project.**

I'm very proud of this webpage, as I have been putting off the Odin Project for a long time. This is actually my 3rd attempt, since I didn't fully understand the concept of flexbox in the past 2 attempts. I guess that's an important and valuable lesson.

I look forward to my adventures in JavaScript coming up. I've started to think if I want to do the Ruby on Rails path, or Node.js.

Either way, I'm excited for the next part of my web dev journey. I had a ton of fun designing this web page because I've recently gotten into watching Kakegurui (the anime).

Inspiration for this webpage is credited in the header.
